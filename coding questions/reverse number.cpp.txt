int main() {
    // Write C++ code here
    int n,rev=0;
    cout<<"enter the number";
    cin>>n;
    while(n>0)
    {
        rev=rev*10+n%10;
        n=n/10;
    }
    cout<<"Reverse is :"<<rev<<endl;
    

    return 0;
}
in place of n%10 during execution it is taking only remainder of the divided number and in n/10 the whole number is didvided by 10
